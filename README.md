# Bankruptcy-Prediction
- Tech Stack: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas
- Midterm project for FRE 7773 Machine Learning in Python (Spring 2020)


### Objectives
For the student to demonstrate mastery on solving a classification problem and presenting the entire Recipe for Machine Learning process in a notebook.

### The problem
To predict whether a company will go bankrupt in the following year, based on financial attributes of the company.

- Each row of data corresponds to a single company
- There are 64 attributes, described in the section below
- The last column (Bankrupt) is 1 if the company subsequently went bankrupt; 0 if it did not go bankrupt
- The first column is a Company Identifier

### Extra credit opportunities
- Address the issue of: classes being imbalanced
- Address the issue of: Different importance of each type of misclassification
